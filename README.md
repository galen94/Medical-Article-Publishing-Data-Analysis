# Medical-Article-Publishing-Data-Analysis

Designed and implemented a normalized, relational OLTP database in mySQL using data acquired by looping through
an inconsistent XML file node by node in R.

Transformed normalized schema into a star schema suitable for OLAP and implemented the star schema to perform
simple data mining. Used Amazon RDS to store the OLTP and OLAP databases that were created in RStudio.

From our findings we can report that there are more author publications in the fall and more journal publications in the winter.
